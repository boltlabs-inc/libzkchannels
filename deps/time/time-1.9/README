`time' is a program that measures many of the CPU resources, such as
time and memory, that other programs use.  The GNU version can format
the output in arbitrary ways by using a printf-style format string to
include various resource measurements.  Some systems do not provide
much information about program resource use; `time' reports
unavailable information as zero values.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

Mail suggestions and bug reports for GNU time to
bug-time@gnu.org.  Please include the version of
`time', which you can get by running `time --version', and the
operating system and C compiler you used.
