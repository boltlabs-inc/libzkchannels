    "Our current version of zkChannels on Tezos uses two smart contracts. The first is ```zkchannels_pssig.tz```, which defines the rules governing the channel, such as when the channel is considered open, closed, or in dispute. The second contract is ```pssig.tz```, which performs the Pointcheval-Sanders (PS) Signature verification. PS signatures are used in zkChannels for the merchant to provide a blind signature on the channel's state, so that the customer can update the state without revealing its contents to the merchant.\n",
