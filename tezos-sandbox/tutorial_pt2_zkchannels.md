# zkChannels Tutorial

In part 1, we went over how to set up a Tezos node running in sandbox mode. If you do not have a Tezos sandbox node running, please refer to part 1. Here, we will learn how to set up a local payment channel between a customer and a merchant. 

The schema will be the following.
                        
    + -------- +                   + -------- +
    | Customer | <-- zkchannel --> | Merchant |

## The contracts

Our current version of zkChannels on Tezos uses two smart contracts. The first is ```zkchannels_mock_pssig.tz```, which defines the rules governing the channel, such as when the channel is considered open, closed, or in dispute. The second contract is ```mock_pssig.tz```, which performs the Pointcheval-Sanders (PS) Signature verification. PS signatures are used in zkChannels for the merchant to provide a blind signature on the channel's state, so that the customer can update the state without revealing its contents to the merchant.

Make sure the two contract files,  ```zkchannels_mock_pssig.tz``` and ```mock_pssig.tz``` are in the current directory. Alternatively, you can use the full file path when referencing them during contract origination.

The files are located in the ```libzkchannels/tezos-sandbox/tests_python/mock_ps/``` subdirectory.
TODO: Come up with a better way of organising files.

### Contract Origination

As part of originating the contracts, we will need to define our initial storage parameters that go with them. Since the ```zkchannels_mock_ps.tz``` contract will need to reference the on-chain address of the ```mock_pssig.tz``` contract, we will need to originate the ```mock_pssig.tz``` contract first so that we know its address. Below is the command that will originate the contract with the arguments included.

After running the following command, hit enter.

```
$ tezos-client originate contract pssig_contract transferring 0 from bootstrap1 running mock_pssig.tz --init Unit --burn-cap 9&
```

Breaking down the components:
- ```pssig_contract``` : The alias we will use to refer to our contract locally.
- ```transferring 0``` : Since we are only originating a contract and not sending funds, we transfer 0 tez.
- ```mock_pssig.tz``` : Our smart contract. (Make sure it is in the current directory.)
- ```--init Unit```: The contract does not take in any storage arguments, so the default value is ```Unit```
- ```--burn-cap 9```: Specifies the maximum amount of tez we are willing to consume as gas costs. ```9``` is a large enough value that we will not hit the limit. 

Next, we want to bake a block so that the origination is confirmed on chain:

```
$ tezos-client bake for baker5 --minimal-timestamp
```

If the contract was successfully originated, then the address of the contract will be displayed to you. You will need this when originating the main zkChannel contract. You can also find the address of the contract later by running:

```
$ tezos-client show known contract pssig_contract
```

Next we would like to originate our zkChannel contract, but in order to do so we need to define some parameters which will go into the channel's initial storage. 

First, we'll need the customer's address and public key. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the ```bootstrap1``` account for our customer. We can find these by running:

```
$ tezos-client show address bootstrap1
```

Now, we'll do the same for the merchant. For the merchant we'll use the account ```bootstrap2```.

```
$ tezos-client show address bootstrap2
```

Next, we'll need to set a revocation secret and revocation lock for the initial channel state. This is what allows a merchant to dispute the channel balance if the customer broadcasts an old state. Note that these would be automatically generated by the zkChannel node implementation, but for now we will define them manually. The revocation lock is a sha256 hash of the revocation secret. 

For our example we will use the following values (this is not a command):

```
# secret_final = 0x123456789ccc
# rev_lock_final = "0x90d774c7ce82fbe85a7bd34bf9cbb00689e1352e7bf6b54591ccd0d3fde9d729"
```

Another value we need during establishment is the ```self_delay```. This defines the delay period (in seconds) between when a customer can post the closing transaction to when they can claim their balance. This delay ensures that the merchant has enough time to broadcast their dispute transaction, if the customer attempted to close on a revoked state. This value should be defined by the merchant, and should be fixed across all of the merchant's channels. For our tutorial we will choose a very short delay period of 3 seconds. In practise this would be on the order of hours or days.

```
# self_delay = 3
```

Finally, we will need to specify the initial balances. The initial balances correspond to how much each party will fund the channel. In this example the customer will start off with 20 tez and the merchant with 10 tez. It is possible to fund the channel unilaterally, in which case the value for the other party will just be 0 tez.

Here is the complete template of the command used to originate the main zkChannel contract (this is not a command):

```
tezos-client originate contract my_zkchannel transferring 0 from bootstrap1 running zkchannel_mock_ps.tz --init '(Pair (Pair (Pair "randomchanid" (Pair "<cust_address>" 0)) (Pair (Pair <cust_balance> "<cust_pubkey") (Pair "0" "<merch_address>"))) (Pair (Pair 0 (Pair <merch_balance> "<merch_pubkey>")) (Pair (Pair "<pssig_contract_address>"  <revocation_lock>) (Pair <self_delay> "awaitingFunding"))))' --burn-cap 9&
```

Breaking down the components:
- ```my_zkchannel``` : The alias we will use to refer to our contract locally.
- ```zkchannel_mock_ps.tz``` : Our smart contract. (Make sure it is in the current directory.)
- ```--init (Pair (Pair ...``` : These are the initial storage parameters being entered. Michelson storage is formatted in pairs, and the specific structure of the pairing will be fixed for given contract.
- ```"randomchanid"``` : The channel ID. In practise this will be a randomly generated string.
- ```"awaitingFunding"```: The initial state that the channel will be in when established.

Filling in the fields with the values recorded above, we should get exactly the following:

```
$ tezos-client originate contract my_zkchannel transferring 0 from bootstrap1 running zkchannel_mock_ps.tz --init '(Pair (Pair (Pair "randomchanid" (Pair "tz1KqTpEZ7Yob7QbPE4Hy4Wo8fHG8LhKxZSx" 0)) (Pair (Pair 20000000 "edpkuBknW28nW72KG6RoHtYW7p12T6GKc7nAbwYX5m8Wd9sDVC9yav") (Pair "0" "tz1gjaF81ZRRvdzjobyfVNsAeSC6PScjfQwN"))) (Pair (Pair 0 (Pair 10000000 "edpktzNbDAUjUk697W7gYg2CRuBQjyPxbEg8dLccYYwKSKvkPvjtV9")) (Pair (Pair "KT1Jbw6ZUf1nbKedLndHMQBzkwk8Yk91QAuG"  0x90d774c7ce82fbe85a7bd34bf9cbb00689e1352e7bf6b54591ccd0d3fde9d729) (Pair 3 "awaitingFunding"))))' --burn-cap 9&
```
Hit enter, then bake a block:
```
$ tezos-client bake for baker5
```
If that worked successfully, you should see the details of the origination as well as a message:
```
Contract memorized as my_zkchannel
```

### Activate

### Unlink

### Funding the channel on chain

To fund the customer's side of the channel we will transfer the exact amount specified during origination to the contract from the customer's account (```bootstrap1```). We will also specify the _entrypoint_ of the on-chain contract we are interacting with:
```
$ tezos-client transfer 20 from bootstrap1 to my_channel --burn-cap 9 --entrypoint addFunding&
```
- ```20``` : The amount of tez  being transfered to the contract must equal the amount specified during contract origination.
- ```my_zkchannel``` : We reference our on-chain zkChannel contract using the alias defined during origination.
- ```addFunding``` : The entrypoint used when funding.

Bake a block:
```
$ tezos-client bake for baker5
```
Now we will do the same for the merchant:
```
$ tezos-client transfer 10 from bootstrap2 to my_zkchannel --burn-cap 9 --entrypoint addFunding&
```
Bake a block:
```
$ tezos-client bake for baker5
```
Now, we should be able to check that the status of the zkChannel contract has changed from ```"awaitingFunding"``` to ```open``` by viewing its storage:
```
$ tezos-client get contract storage for my_zkchannel
```
And we can check that its balance is 30 tez using:
```
$ tezos-client get balance for my_zkchannel
```

## Pay


## Mutual Close
In the case of a mutual close, both the customer and merchant need to sign off on the final state. The final state that gets signed needs to be serialized in a specific way according to how it'll be checked in the on-chain contract. The command to create the serialized data to be signed, and the format of the storage is as follows:

```
tezos-client hash data '(Pair (Pair "<channel_id> <cust_address>) (Pair "<merch_address>" (Pair <cust_balance> <merch_balance> )))' of type 'pair (pair string address) (pair address (pair mutez mutez))'
```
Breaking down the components:
- ```hash data``` : The command that will give us our serialized data to be signed.
- ```of type pair (pair...``` : This lets the tezos node know what structure and types to expect.

Filling in the fields, we get:

```
$ tezos-client hash data '(Pair (Pair "randomchanid" "tz1KqTpEZ7Yob7QbPE4Hy4Wo8fHG8LhKxZSx") (Pair "tz1gjaF81ZRRvdzjobyfVNsAeSC6PScjfQwN" (Pair 1000000 29000000 )))' of type 'pair (pair string address) (pair address (pair mutez mutez))'
```

The terminal should return a result with a field ```Raw packed data```. This is what we'll sign the customer and merchant's account. First, with the customer's account (```bootstrap1```):

```
$ tezos-client sign bytes 0x0507070707010000000c72616e646f6d6368616e69640a00000016000002298c03ed7d454a101eb7022bc95f7e5f41ac7807070a000000160000e7670f32038107a59a2b9cfefae36ea21f5aa63c07070080897a008085d41b for bootstrap1
```
and with the merchant's account (```bootstrap2```):
```
$ tezos-client sign bytes 0x0507070707010000000c72616e646f6d6368616e69640a00000016000002298c03ed7d454a101eb7022bc95f7e5f41ac7807070a000000160000e7670f32038107a59a2b9cfefae36ea21f5aa63c07070080897a008085d41b for bootstrap2
```

Now that we have both signatures on the final state of the channel, we can initiate the mutual close!

```
tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap1 to my_zkchannel --entrypoint mutualClose --burn-cap 9 --arg '(Pair (Pair "<cust_signature" "<merch_signature>") (Pair 1000000 29000000))'&
```

Filling in the signatures:

```
$ tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap1 to my_zkchannel --entrypoint mutualClose --burn-cap 9 --arg '(Pair (Pair "edsigtYVTS2pJoXt8eARKnZGtFa8g9i8buUe7AVDtcfv7nbFykAhwZTr9dHSi9jxUbsU66K4aetdtA8tJyVrjzwapx9FB3eoKtR" "edsigtfpHDYiu56zvvXJujdMP3HjidSFd17L8Wgw3VvrghkJTCUKe81YtscWV9PJnTK7g4uGV8s4dqRy2dMayvUGyuXqznSjMgr") (Pair 1000000 29000000))'&
```
This should result in the zkChannel transitioning to the ```closed``` state, and with the customer and merchant receiving their final balance payouts.

## Unilateral Close

### Customer close
If the customer wishes to close the channel, and the merchant was not cooperative, the customer can initiate channel closure via the ```custClose``` entrypoint. In order for the close to be valid, the storage parameters must include the final state and the merchant's signatures on them:
```
tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap1 to my_zkchannel --entrypoint custClose --burn-cap 9 --arg '(Pair (Pair (Pair "<g2>" "<merchPk0>") (Pair "<merchPk1>" (Pair "<merchPk2>" "<merchPk3>"))) (Pair (Pair "<merchPk4>" (Pair <cust_balance> <merch_balance>)) (Pair <revocation_lock> (Pair "<s1>" "<s2>"))))'&
```
With the parameters filled it in should look something like this:
```
$ tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap1 to my_zkchannel --entrypoint custClose --burn-cap 9 --arg '(Pair (Pair (Pair "dummy_g2" "dummy_merchPk0") (Pair "dummy_merchPk1" (Pair "dummy_merchPk2" "dummy_merchPk3"))) (Pair (Pair "dummy_merchPk4" (Pair 1000000 29000000)) (Pair 0x90d774c7ce82fbe85a7bd34bf9cbb00689e1352e7bf6b54591ccd0d3fde9d729 (Pair "dummy_s1" "dummy_s2"))))'&
```

### Expiry

```
$ tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap2 to my_zkchannel --burn-cap 9 --entrypoint merchClose&
```

### Claiming payouts
If the channel was closed unilaterally, after the ```self_delay``` period has expired, the customer or merchant who is waiting to receive their funds can do so via the ```custClaim``` or ```merchClaim``` entrypoints respectively. Note that in order for time to progress in our sandbox mode, blocks would need to be baked using the standard ```bake``` command. The command for the customer would be:
```
$ tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap1 to my_zkchannel --entrypoint custClaim --burn-cap 9&
```
and for the merchant:
```
$ tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap2 to my_zkchannel --entrypoint merchClaim --burn-cap 9&
```

### Disputes
If the customer posts an old (previously revoked) state, the merchant should dispute it via the ```merchDispute``` entrypoint. To prove that the state was revoked, the merchant must provide the revocation secret:

```
tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap2 to my_zkchannel --entrypoint merchDispute --burn-cap 9 --arg <revocation_secret>&
```
Filling in the revocation secret using our example:

```
$ tezos-client transfer 0 from bootstrap2 to my_zkchannel --entrypoint merchDispute --burn-cap 9 --arg 0x123456789ccc&
```
